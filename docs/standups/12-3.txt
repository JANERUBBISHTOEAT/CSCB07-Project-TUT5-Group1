Name: Zheyuan Wei

What have you done since yesterday?
	- Reviewed all active branches and merged them into master branch and test branch
	- Fixed all conflicts in the merge process
	- Protect test branch by
		creating a new branch from test branch and set the protection rules.

What are you planning on doing today?
	- Keep tracking the active branches and merge them into master branch and test branch
	- Write the document corresponding to the scrum members' work,
		and updated it every time when the scrum members has gained new progress,
		since there are still 3 unfinished tasks in the sprint backlog, and the
		remaining time is less than 2 days.

Any impediments or stumbling blocks?
	- Scrum members' work is not enough to finish all the tasks in the sprint backlog.
	- The test branch is not protected, and merge conflicts was wrongly resolved many times
		by the scrum members, which caused the test branch to be broken many times.
	- Scrum members are responding to the issues in the test branch very slowly.
